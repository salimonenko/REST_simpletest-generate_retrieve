# REST_simpletest-generate-retrieve
The simple REST-API example with only two requests: generate() and retrieve(id)

I used the newspaper: https://codeofaninja.com/create-simple-rest-api-in-php/
During about 11 hours I have known what is REST-tecknology is. Because ealier I do not know about such tecknology at all.
Although it woks well, frankly speeking I do not like this. Because it is VERY bulky. But... today it is very popular. Why, where, what... I do not know. 
As for my own use, I wold better do ths in 2...4 files, not so ponderous.
